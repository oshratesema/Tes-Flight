# Tes Flights
## Description
Tes Flights is a flight website. It offers clients search  flights by using API and  searching countries around the world.
## Project Flow
I started the project with a searching API that provides relevant details of flights around the world and i understood how to work with it.
I transferred the data to my page using Fetch.
search for websites of flights and take inspiration for the style of the website, and start to build my site using HTML Scss  and Bootstrap.
The client  can search flights by entering relevant data. Departure, destination, departure date and return date.
Using a loop the client will receive flight offers with data from the API including prices.
When the client chooses one of the offers the data will be saved in the local storage and shown in the page of the order.
The local storage part was challenging for me but in the end I succeeded.
At the end of the website are displayed countries around the world and we can filter countries. The vision of this part was that when we click on a country  , we go to a page that provides information about each country but I could not implement it. I believe I will be able to implement it later in the study.
